# **Only Calc: The only calculator you need**

## **About The Project**

This is a [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that provides its users with a fully functional multi-purpose calculator that hopes to eliminate the need for other specialized calculators for the every day user by providing all the functions they would need in one place.  

## **Intended Features**

Users of this application will be able to:
- Perform simple arithmetic operation involving multiple numbers including but no limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- View and delete a history of their previous calculations with their results from the same session.
- Use the scientifc mode and access various associated with it such as trignometric functions, logarithms to arbitrary bases, access to popular constants such as $e$ or $\pi$. 
- Convert between various numerical bases such as binary (base 2), octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16) with features for different conversion modes such as 2's complement.
- Solve quadratic and cubic equations with one variable
- Solve linear systems of equations with multiple unknown variables.   
- Convert between ASCII/Unicode and their binary/hexadecimal representation.
- Find the derivative at a specific point for a given equation and find definite integrals for a given equation.
- Graph given equations on the 2 dimensional xy-plane.
